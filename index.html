				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="assets/images/rbpp.jpg" alt="My profile pic">
				<p>Throughout my adolescent life I  had a penchant for late nights horror films and the wonderful game of tennis. And while those passions grew to be hobbies, my interest in video as a form of expression and interaction grew. I've been fortunate enough to live in New York, California and now in Orlando for 10 years where I currently run a logistics company. As with most, my journey had, and continues to have many turns.</p>
				<p>While attending grad school in California I discovered my love for interactive design by building interactive video installations. I loved thinking about how people interact with technology in ways that are productive and strange. A few years after moving to Orlando I took up web design and front end development to help my wife launch her pilates studio, and now see it as my passion for the future. A place where my creativity can mesh with practical business applications.</p>
